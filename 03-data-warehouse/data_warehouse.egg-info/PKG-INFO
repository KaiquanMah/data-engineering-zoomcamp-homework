* What is a data warehouse
  * OLAP solution
  * Used for reporting and data analysis 

* BigQuery
  * **Serverless** data warehouse - There are **no servers to manage** or database **software to install**
  * Software as well as infrastructure including 
    * **scalability and high-availability**
  * Built-in features like 
    * ML
    * geospatial analysis
    * business intelligence
  * BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute engine that analyzes your data from your storage
  * eg partiton on `creation_date`
  * within each partition, cluster on `field2 / OS`

* BigQuery Partition
  * **Time-unit** column
  * **Ingestion time** (_PARTITIONTIME)
  * **Integer range** partitioning
  * When using **Time unit or ingestion time**
    * Daily (Default)
    * Hourly
    * Monthly or yearly
  * Number of partitions limit is 4000

* BigQuery Clustering
  * **Columns you specify** are used to **colocate related data**
  * **Order of the column** is **important**
  * The order of the specified columns determines the sort order of the data.
  * Clustering improves
    * **Filter** queries
    * **Aggregate** queries
  * Table with data size < 1 GB, don’t show significant improvement with partitioning and clustering
  * You can specify **up to 4 clustering columns**
  * Clustering columns must be **top-level, non-repeated columns**
    * INT64
    * NUMERIC
    * BIGNUMERIC
    * DATE
    * DATETIME
    * TIMESTAMP
    * GEOGRAPHY
    * STRING
    * BOOL

| Partitioning | Clustering |
| --- | --- |
| **Cost known upfront** | Cost **unknown upfront** |
| You need partition-level management (**create, move, delete partitions btw storage**) |You **need more granularity** than partitioning alone allows | 
| **Filter or aggregate on 1 column** | Your queries commonly use filters or aggregation against **multiple specific columns** |
| NA | The **cardinality/combinations** of the number of values in a column or group of columns is **large** |

* Choose clustering over paritioning when
  * **Partitioning** results in a **SMALL AMOUNT of DATA PER PARTITION (approximately less than 1 GB)**
  * Partitioning results in a **TOO MANY/large number of PARTITIONS beyond the limits on partitioned tables**
  * Partitioning results in your **mutation operations MODIFYING the MAJORITY of PARTITIONS in the table FREQUENTLY** (for example, every few minutes)

 * Automatic reclustering
  * As data is added to a clustered table
    * the **newly inserted data can be written to blocks** that contain key ranges that **overlap** with the key ranges in **previously written blocks**
    * These **overlapping keys weaken the sort property of the table**
  * To maintain the performance characteristics of a clustered table
    * BigQuery performs **automatic re-clustering in the background** to restore the sort property of the table
    * For partitioned tables, **clustering is maintained for data within the scope of EACH PARTITION**

* BigQuery-Best Practice
  * Cost reduction
    * Avoid SELECT *
    * **Price your queries before running** them
    * Use **clustered or partitioned tables**
    * Use streaming inserts with caution????
      * `Streaming insert` costs a certain dollar amount per amount of data inserted (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)
      * `Batch inserts` are free (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#free-operations)
      * use `streaming insert` only if downstream consumers need the data immediately
    * Materialize query results in stages????
      * Break down a complex query into multiple stages/parts
      * Materialize intermediate results for each stage/part
      * Use materialised views in the final complex query
      * Materialised views
        * Use precomputed/stored query results: Reduces the amount of data to be scanned for future queries
  * Query performance
    * **Filter on partitioned columns**
    * **Denormalizing** data
    * Use **nested or repeated columns**????
      * `Repeated col` - denormalises data, so u need less/no JOINs -> dec data scanned during query
      ```sql
      # normalised/higher cost
      -- orders table
      CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id STRING,
        customer_id STRING,
        order_date TIMESTAMP,
        total_amount FLOAT64
      );

      -- order_items table  
      CREATE TABLE order_items (
        order_id STRING,
        product_id STRING,
        quantity INT64,
        price FLOAT64
      );

      -- products table
      CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id STRING,
        product_name STRING,
        category STRING
      );

      --query with JOINs
      SELECT 
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        p.product_name,
        oi.quantity,
        oi.price
      FROM orders o
      JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
      JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
      WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'






      -- Denormalised Schema with Nested/Repeated Fields (Lower Cost)
      -- Single denormalized table with nested structure
      CREATE TABLE orders_denormalized (
        order_id STRING,
        customer_id STRING,
        order_date TIMESTAMP,
        total_amount FLOAT64,
        items ARRAY<STRUCT<
          product_id STRING,
          product_name STRING,
          category STRING,
          quantity INT64,
          price FLOAT64
        >>
      );

      -- denormalised query
      SELECT 
        order_id,
        order_date,
        item.product_name,
        item.quantity,
        item.price
      FROM orders_denormalized,
      UNNEST(items) AS item
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'


      -- Normalized Approach:
      --     Data Scanned:
      --     orders table: 10 GB (all orders)
      --     order_items table: 15 GB (all items)
      --     products table: 2 GB (all products)
      --     Total: 27 GB scanned
      -- Denormalized with Nested Fields:
      --     Data Scanned:
      --     orders_denormalized table: 10 GB (but only 1 month filtered)
      --     Actual scanned after filter: ~0.8 GB (assuming 1 month = 1/12 of data)
      --     Total: 0.8 GB scanned
      -- Cost Savings: ~97% reduction in data scanned!
      ```
    * Use **external data sources** appropriately????
      * Do not use an external data source if you're seeking better performance, unless it is **for frequently changing data that needs real-time access**
      * Consider **loading data into BigQuery native tables for better query performance** when the **data doesn't change frequently**
    * Don't use `it=??? (what is it here????)`, in case u want a high query performance
    * **Reduce data before using a JOIN**
    * Do not treat **WITH clauses** as prepared statements????
      * BigQuery only materializes recursive CTEs, not non-recursive CTEs
      * Data flowing through a CTE **gets shuffled, stored, and read again downstream**, which can significantly increase processing time and cost
      * Better approach: Instead of relying on WITH clauses for performance, **filter data aggressively at the earliest stage** and consider **materialized views for frequently used intermediate results**
    * **Avoid oversharding tables**????
      ```bash
      # oversharding eg
      table_2025_01_01
      table_2025_01_02
      table_2025_01_03
      ...
      ```
      * Creates management overhead - dec query pf cuz need to scan multiple tables
      * sols
        * do not use date (YYYY-MM-DD) partitioned tables
        * time-partitioned tables
    * **Avoid JavaScript user-defined functions**????
      * JavaScript UDFs run in a sandboxed V8 environment with **significant overhead**
        * Higher CPU and memory consumption compared to native SQL functions
        * Can cause query failures due to resource limits or timeouts
      * JS UDF **process data row-by-row (not parallelized efficiently)**
        * No query optimizer benefits - BigQuery can't optimize JS UDF execution
    * Use **approximate aggregation functions (HyperLogLog++)**????
      * HyperLogLog++ algorithm provides **highly accurate approximations (typically <1% error)** with massive performance gains
      * Approximate functions like **APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT use significantly less memory and CPU**
        * Much faster execution time, especially on billion+ row datasets
        * Cost savings by reducing data processed and computation time
    * **Order Last**, for query operations to maximize performance????
      * ORDER BY operations are expensive and don't parallelize well
      * **Sorting** should be **applied to the smallest possible dataset**
      * BigQuery processes queries in stages - **do heavy operations first, sorting last**
      * Reduces memory pressure and improves execution time
      * Minimizes the amount of data that needs to be shuffled and sorted
    * Optimize your join patterns
      * As a best practice,
        * place the **table with the largest number of rows first (distributed evenly)**,
        * followed by the table with the **fewest rows (broadcast to all the nodes)????**, and then
        * place the **remaining tables by decreasing size**
